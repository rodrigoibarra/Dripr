# Dotfiles

After cloning this repo, run './install' to automatically set up dotfiles for your Mac. Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run multiple times. Also... this is pretty opinionated since it comes straight from my computer.

Puntos uses [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for installation.

## What's in this?

Right now, i'ts got configuration for:
- Atom
- Oh-my-git (this is a oh-my-zsh thing with git...)
- git
